# TerraWeek Day 4 🌱

## Task 1: Importance of Terraform State

📚 **Research**: Dive into the importance of Terraform state in managing infrastructure. Discover how Terraform state helps track the current state of resources and ensures smooth infrastructure provisioning and management.

## Task 2: Local State and `terraform state` Command

📚 **Understand**: Explore different methods of storing the state file, such as local or remote storage. Create a simple Terraform configuration file and initialize it to generate a local state file. Get hands-on with the `terraform state` command and learn how to use it effectively to manage and manipulate resources.

## Task 3: Remote State Management

📚 **Explore**: Delve into remote state management options like Terraform Cloud, AWS S3, Azure Storage Account, or HashiCorp Consul. Select one remote state management option and thoroughly research its setup and configuration process. Become familiar with the steps required to leverage remote state management in your Terraform workflow.

## Task 4: Remote State Configuration

📚 **Modify**: Enhance your Terraform configuration file to store the state remotely using the chosen remote state management option. Include the necessary backend configuration block in your Terraform configuration file to enable seamless remote state storage and access.

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "<chosen_backend>" {
    # Add required configuration options for the chosen backend
  }
}
```
